    comment: "TOTAL HACK, writing into TARGET. How the heck do you get the other json in there?"
    comment-reply: >-
      export true allows it to be exported to target, 
      mimetype javascript is a hack to use a publisher that works, we should be able
      to either add a json publisher or, general data publisher so this ends up in data/times.json.

      line1: >-
        Hurricane Matthew approached the southeastern U.S. coast on October 7, 2016.
        In the map above, the hurricane’s impact on precipitation and streamflow are 
        shown. Normalized discharge (cubic feet per second) 
        at a selection of US Geological Survey gaging stations within ~200 km of the eye of the hurricane is shown 
        in the right panel. Variation in the shape of the hydrographs (right panel) 
        is due to stream size, storm-surge, reservoir closures, and other local conditions, 
        which can impact the effect of precipitation on flow. Gages shown do not 
        include the US Geological Survey Short-Term Network gages deployed to capture 
        more detailed effects of the hurricane (

        ordered by latitude and normalized to site-specific maximum discharge observed over the duration of the hurricane.
